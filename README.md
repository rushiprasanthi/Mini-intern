# Project Overview

Smart Energy Advisor is a full-stack web application that helps users understand how different energy sources impact the environment. The platform provides an interactive simulation where users can create custom energy mixes using Solar, Wind, Hydro, Coal, and Petroleum energy sources and instantly visualize their environmental consequences.

The system calculates Pollution Scores, CO₂ Emissions, Sustainability Scores, and Cost Index values while generating personalized recommendations to encourage sustainable energy choices.

The project is designed as an educational sustainability simulation that transforms theoretical concepts into an interactive learning experience.

# Problem Statement

Many students and general users lack a clear understanding of how energy source selection affects environmental sustainability. Traditional learning methods often rely on static text and theoretical explanations, making it difficult to visualize the real-world consequences of energy decisions.

As a result, users struggle to compare renewable and non-renewable energy sources and understand their impact on pollution, carbon emissions, and sustainability.

# HMW (How Might We)

**How might we help students and general users understand the environmental impact of different energy sources through an interactive simulation instead of relying on traditional theoretical learning methods?**
